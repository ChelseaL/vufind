; This section contains global settings affecting search behavior.
; For PrimoCentral API doumentation: 
; http://www.exlibrisgroup.org/display/PrimoOI/Brief+Search
; Note: you will need your EL Commons credentials to access documenation
[General]
; This setting controls the default sort order of search results; the selected
; option should be one of the options present in the [Sorting] section below.
default_sort         = relevance

; If this setting is true, boolean operators in searches (AND/OR/NOT) will only 
; be recognized if they are ALL UPPERCASE.  If set to false, they will be 
; recognized regardless of case.
case_sensitive_bools = true

; HTTP timeout
timeout = 30

; Your API id
apiId = my-id

; These are the default recommendations modules to use when no specific setting
; are found in the [TopRecommendations] or [SideRecommendations] sections below.
; See the comments above those sections for details on legal settings.  You may
; repeat these lines to load multiple recommendations.
;
; Right now, VuFind is configured to use Summon database recommendations at the
; top of the search results and all facets to the side.  You can reconfigure
; this by changing the default_top_recommend setting and [Facets] / [FacetsTop]
; sections below.
;default_top_recommend[] = BestBetsResults
;default_top_recommend[] = TopFacets:FacetsTop:Summon
default_side_recommend[] = SideFacets:Facets:CheckboxFacets:Primo

; Set this to true in order to highlight keywords from the search query when they
; appear in fields displayed in search results (may not apply to all fields).
highlighting = true

; This section is used to set general parameters for URL generation to make a call to the Primo API
bulkSize = 20

; Primo has a fixed cap on how many results you can page through.  Even though
; it may report more results than this number, you can't actually access results
; past the limit.  This setting tells VuFind where to cut off its paging mechanism.
result_limit = 3980

; The following two sections can be used to associate specific recommendations
; modules with specific search types defined in the [Basic_Searches] section
; below.  For all the details on how these sections work, see the comments above
; the equivalent sections of searches.ini.  Recommendations work the same in
; Summon as they do in the regular Search module.
[SideRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.
;[TopRecommendations]
; No search-specific settings by default -- add your own here.

; This section is used to identify facets for special treatment by the SideFacets
; recommendations module.
[SpecialFacets]
; Any fields listed below will be treated as date ranges rather than plain facets:
dateRange[] = creationdate

; The order of display is as shown below
; The name of the index field is on the left
; The display name of the field is on the right
;
; The name of the index field may optionally be followed by comma-separated
; parameters (i.e. ",or,1,15") as defined by the Summon API.  Any provided 
; parameters will override defaults like the facet_limit setting in
; [Facet_Settings] below.

; Any facets named in the list below will have their values run through the 
; translation code; unlisted facets will displayed as-is without translation.  For

; translated -- uncomment or add lines below to turn on this feature.

; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of Summon pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with an
; index defined in the Summon API.  The value of each setting is the text to 
; display on screen.  All on-screen text will be run through the translator, so 
; be sure to update language files if necessary.  The order of these settings 
; will be maintained in the drop-down list in the UI.
;
; Note: The search type of "AllFields" is a special case that searches all
;       fields.  All remaining values are from the list documented here:

; This section defines the sort options available on Summon search results.
; Values on the left of the equal sign are either the reserved term "relevance"
; or the name of a Summon index to use for sorting; asc and desc modifiers may be 
; used in combination with index names, but not relevance.  Values on the right 
; of the equal sign are text that will be run through the translation module and 
; displayed on screen.
;
; PrimoCentral sorting can only go in one direction - either ASC for ascending
; or DESC for descending. In order to change the sort direction you must go into
; the primo backend in Primo Home > Advanced Configuration > All Mapping Tables 
; Sort Fields Config and make your changes there.

; Consortial example:
;regex[] = "/^1\.2\..*/"    ; match IPs starting with 1.2.
